## A Personal Review on OSCP Certificate

If you are also a security person like I am, you might have already heard of the famous certificate of OSCP - Offensive Security Certified Professional. 

Contrary to most security certificates, OSCP is very unique in the following ways:
1. There is no official textbook, no classroom training. You will be given a virtual lab environment.
2. The exam is not Multiple-Choice based. You will need to conduct a simulated penetration test
3. You don't need to pay to renew the certificate every year
4. You really need to Try Harder

In short, it's a challenging while rewarding certificate to get for us infosec people. 

### Preparation Studies
You can skip this section if:
1. You don't mind spending a lot of money on purchasing additional lab time (US$250 for a month)
2. You already know how to do a proper penetration test (Not merely a automatic vulnerability scan)

For those who haven't skipped, here I briefly summarised the required knowledge you should have before you go into the charged lab environment:
1. How to use security tools like Nmap, Nikto, Dirb, Burp Suite, Metasploit.
A good tutorial is:[https://www.offensive-security.com/metasploit-unleashed/](https://www.offensive-security.com/metasploit-unleashed/)

2. How to read and modify programs written in C, Python, shell script (You don't need to write a program from scratch, but occationally you might need to modify a particular part to make things work)

3. Have an idea about Buffer Overflow.
A good tutorial is [http://www.primalsecurity.net/0x0-exploit-tutorial-buffer-overflow-vanilla-eip-overwrite-2/](http://www.primalsecurity.net/0x0-exploit-tutorial-buffer-overflow-vanilla-eip-overwrite-2/)

4. Get familar with what a lab machine will look like.
On Vulnhub.com there are plenty of CTF style VMs for you to play with. A good start will be the Kioptrix series: [https://www.vulnhub.com/series/kioptrix,8/](https://www.vulnhub.com/series/kioptrix,8/) [This step is optional]
